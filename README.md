# Simple_Banking_system
This is a small demo of a banking system using Python and SQL. This program will allow the user to create an account which will generate a card number and PIN for that card. It will also allow the user to log into their account by entering the card details and the PIN. 

After logging into the account, the user will be allowed to add money, transfer money, close account and view the current balance. All the card details and the balance will be saved in the SQL database.
